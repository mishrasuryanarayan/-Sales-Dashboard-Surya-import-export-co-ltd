The project is based on Ecommerce sales insights from the Sales Dashboard of Surya import & export co. ltd. Company

Objective - As a data analyst, I collaborated with the owner of the Sales Dashboard of Surya import & export co. ltd company to create a comprehensive dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India. The dashboard provides valuable insights and visualizations to enhance decision-making and improve sales strategies.

Tool Used: #MicroSoft PowerBI

Skills used: #charts, #filters, #slicers, #connections, #calculations

Analysis of Dataset:
🔹I started by cleaning and transforming the data to derive proper insights.
🔹I have included some important KPIs like Total Profit, Total Amount, Total Quantity of products, Average Order Value, etc.
🔹I have added slicers to track all the parameters quarterly and state-wise.
🔹Used different types of customized visualizations like bar chart, pie charts, donut charts, etc.

Insights drawn from the dashboard:

🔹 The Top 5 customers who have made maximum purchases can be rewarded with some gift vouchers for being loyal customers.
🔹 If we check by category of the products, we can see that Clothing has made the best sales and Furniture the least. So, we can try to give some exciting discounts and offers on Furniture to grab the customer's attention and increase sales.
🔹 The Top 5 states that have made maximum profit are Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. In the rest of the cities, we should try to promote our company more.
🔹 Overall we have earned good profit in the months of November and January and incurred loss in the month of May.
🔹 The most preferred mode of payment is COD, hence we should make it a point to have the COD option available for all the products.
🔹 We have performed the best in Quarter 1 and the lowest in Quarter 3.
